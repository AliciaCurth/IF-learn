# IF-learn 
Learning algorithms for machine learning based estimation and inference on structural target functions, such as conditional average treatment effects, using influence functions (Work in progress).

This repository is structured as follows: 
(1) iflearn -- contains sklearn-style implementations of model-agnostic learning algorithms (sometimes also referred to as Meta-learners), currently only for treatment effect estimation. Tutorial TBA. 
(2) paper_utils.if_paper -- contains utils to replicate the simulation studies in Curth, Alaa & van der Schaar (2020). With a working rpy2 installation, these can be run using the notebook 'Simulation studies.ipynb'. 


This code was written by Alicia Curth during a research (dissertation) internship at the vanderschaar-lab at the University of Cambridge, and was used in a dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Science in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford in September 2020.
